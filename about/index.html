		<h1>About</h1>
			<div class = "AboutText">
		    <p>I am a freelance filmmaker and photographer living in Marin County, California.
				<br><br>
				I held a year-long internship with a San Francisco-based film production company, Liars & Thieves, and worked on the full-length documentary Artifishal. The film was commissioned by Patagonia, and explores a controversial ecological issue. I learned about the elements that need to come together during the production of a feature-length film, from conception to theater. Having the opportunity to help manage time constraints and larger budgets, I learned to work efficiently, while also thinking about each project as a whole, and keeping track of details to help the producers achieve their vision. Because the team was very small, I was directly involved with production, editing, and finalizing the film for submission to a number of festivals. My experience includes music videos, product photography, color grading and corporate film editing. I'm looking for more experience shooting short commercial videos and documentaries, and I love shooting photos of people and architectureâ€”and anything outdoors.
				<br><br>
				Experienced in: Photoshop : Lightroom : Blender : Premiere Pro : Final Cut Pro X : DaVinci Resolve.
				I am a current student at University of California Santa Cruz, Film & Digital Media.
				<br><br>
				I believe filmmaking and photography are beautiful ways to tell a meaningful story.</p>
